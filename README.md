## Introduction
The Attention Mechanism is a crucial component in many state-of-the-art NLP models. It allows the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence, improving performance on tasks such as translation, summarization, and more.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/attention-nlp.git
cd attention-nlp
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
You can use the provided scripts to train and evaluate models with attention mechanisms. Below is an example of how to run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --config config.yaml
```

## Examples
We have included several examples to demonstrate the use of attention mechanisms in different NLP tasks. Check the `examples` directory for more details.
