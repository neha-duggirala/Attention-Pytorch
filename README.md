## From RNNs to LLMs: The Evolution of NLP (A New Series!)

### 🔍 Ever wondered how we went from simple Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to today’s powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents?

Over the next few weeks, I'll take you on a journey through the evolution of NLP—breaking down architectures, sharing intuitive analogies, key findings from research papers, code implementations, and frequently asked interview questions.

### 💡 What you’ll gain from this series:
- Understand how RNNs evolved into Transformers and beyond
- Learn key architectures like LSTMs, GRUs, Transformers, and LLMs
- Discover the latest breakthroughs in AI agents 
- Get access to useful resources and hands-on coding examples
- Prepare for NLP interviews with frequently asked questions

### 🔑 Who is this for?
If you have a basic understanding of Python, ML fundamentals, linear algebra, probability, and neural networks, you’ll benefit immensely!
